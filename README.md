# GSTV Full Stack Coding Exercise

## What We Are Looking For



### System Requirements
* Node.js `^4.0.0`
* MongoDB `^3.2.0`

### Version Control
#### GitFlow and GithubFlow
We use [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/) on a daily basis - this allows us to build quality control into our development, QA and deployment process.

We are asking that you use a modified [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) - sometimes referred to as a [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) - methodology instead of GitFlow. Conceptually, GitFlow and Github flow are similar.

#### Submitting Your Work
Please fork our repository and use a feature branch workflow while developing your functionality. When you are ready to submit your work make a [pull request against our repository](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### JavaScript
#### Unit Testing
Please feel free to create unit tests - we use [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha).
